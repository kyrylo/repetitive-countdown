Description
-----------

Repetitive Countdown is a Chrome extension, which helps you to keep track of the
time.

Synopsis
--------

As a user presses `ON` button Repetitive Countdown starts making its dirty job.
Namely, it will be active all along unless you turn it off explicitly. There are
two phases: the main countdown and the timeout. The main countdown phase starts
first. The timeout phase comes next and usually should be shorter (but that is
not mandatory). The unit used for the measurement of time is a minute. Default
values:

  * The main countdown — 75 minutes;
  * The timeout — 6 minutes.

In the end of each phase you will be hearing sound notifications.

A word from the author
----------------------

The reason I wrote this extension is that I want to take care of my eyes. You
can often see me staring at the monitor all day long. I concluded that I need to
take a short break every hour or so. I knew the extension would come in handy.
